<p style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold; font-size: 24px; color: #9D2235">Welcome to the Aery Jones Lab!
</p>

The Aery Jones lab launched in January 2026 in the [Department of Neurobiology](https://neurobiology.umaryland.edu/) at [Medicine Institute for Neuroscience Discovery](https://www.medschool.umaryland.edu/um-mind/) at the University of Maryland, Baltimore.


Our lab dissects how the hippocampal circuit can flexibly perform distinct computations to support spatial memory and how these computations degrade in aging and Alzheimer's disease. Learn more on our [research](/research), [publications](/publications), and [resource](/resources) pages.


I'm accepting rotation students in spring and summer quarters and have openings for a research technician and postdoc with start dates in 2027. Come [join our lab](/join)!
