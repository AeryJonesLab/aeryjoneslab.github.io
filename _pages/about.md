<p style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold; font-size: 24px; color: #9D2235">Welcome to the Aery Jones Lab!
</p>

The Aery Jones lab will launch in January 2026 in the [Department of Neurobiology](https://neurobiology.umaryland.edu/) at [Medicine Institute for Neuroscience Discovery](https://www.medschool.umaryland.edu/um-mind/) at the University of Maryland, Baltimore.


Our lab will dissect how the hippocampal circuit can flexibly perform distinct computations to support spatial memory and how these computations degrade in aging and Alzheimer's disease. Learn more on our [research](/research), [publications](/publications), and [resource](/resources) pages.


I'll be accepting rotation students in all three quarters and have openings for a research technician and postdoc. Come [join our lab](/join)!
